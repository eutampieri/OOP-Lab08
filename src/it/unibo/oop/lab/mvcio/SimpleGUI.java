     *

     * below (see "ex02.png" for the expected result). SUGGESTION: Use a JPanel with
     * BorderLayout
     * 
     * 4) By default, if the graphical interface is closed the program must exit
     * (call setDefaultCloseOperation)

     * 5) The program asks the controller to save the file if the button "Save" gets
     * pressed.
